               <h1>SPACE A by Bhageeruthy Theerath</h1><h6> Early in the morning of 4 October 1957, T. Keith Glennan went to work, just as he had for more than a decade, at the president's office of the Case Institute of Technology (CIT) in Cleveland, Ohio. As president of CIT, he had been instrumental in transforming it from a small commuter school turning out journeymen engineers and other technicians into one of the top 20 technical institutions of higher learning in the United States.1 He was pleased with the results of his presidency, and quite happy to continue those efforts, but on that Friday Glennan's career path changed sharply. Because of the events of that day he soon became caught up in the vortex of superpower rivalries and projects to enhance international prestige. Less than a year later he would be in Washington, D.C., serving as head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), a newly-constituted, federal research and development agency charged with helping to define and execute a far-reaching space exploration effort.</h6><br>

There is no atmosphere in space, which means that sound has no medium or way to travel to be heard. Astronauts use radios to stay in communication while in space, since radio waves can still be sent and received.
