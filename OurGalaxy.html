             <br><br><br><br><br><br<h6><i><b>THERE MAY BE LIFE ON MARS.
Of all the planets in our solar system (apart from Earth), Mars is the one most likely to be hospitable to life. In 1986, NASA found what they thought may be fossils of microscopic living things in a rock recovered from Mars.

</b></i></h6><br>
    <h6><b><i>NOBODY KNOWS HOW MANY STARS ARE IN SPACE.
The sheer size of space makes it impossible to accurately predict just how many stars we have. Right now, scientists and astronomers use the number of stars only within our galaxy, The Milky Way, to estimate. That number is between 200-400 billion stars and there are estimated to be billions of galaxies so the stars in space really are completely uncountable.</i></b></h6><br>
    <h6><i><b>NEUTRON STARS CAN SPIN 600 TIMES PER SECOND.
Neutron stars are the densest and tiniest stars in the known universe and although they only have a radius of about 10 km (6 mi), they may have a mass of a few times that of the Sun. They can rotate at up to 60 times per second after they are born from a core-collapse supernova star explosion and have been known to spin as fast as 600-712 times per second because of their physics.

</b></i></h6>

   
   <h6><b><i>THERE MAY BE A PLANET MADE OUT OF DIAMONDS.
As space facts go, this is pretty impressive. Research by Yale University scientists suggests that a rocky planet called 55 Cancri e — which has a radius twice Earth’s, and a mass eight times greater – may have a surface made up of graphite and diamond. It’s 40 light years away but visible to the naked eye in the constellation of Cancer.</i></b></h6>
   <h6><i><b>IN 3.75 BILLION YEARS THE MILKY WAY AND ANDROMEDA GALAXIES WILL COLLIDE.
The Andromeda Galaxy is approaching the Milky Way – where our solar system is – at rate of around 110 kilometres per second (68 mi/s) and eventually the two will collide to form a giant elliptical galaxy.</b></i></h6>
   <h6><b><i>    IF TWO PIECES OF THE SAME TYPE OF METAL TOUCH IN SPACE THEY WILL PERMANENTLY BOND.
This incredible fact is also known as cold welding and it happens because the atoms of two pieces of metal have no way of knowing they are separate. This doesn’t happen on Earth because of the air and water found between the pieces.

</i></b></h6>
   <h6><i><b>    THE SUN’S MASS TAKES UP 99.86% OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.
Made of three quarters hydrogen and helium for most of its remaining mass, the Sun accounts for 99.86% of the mass in our solar system with a mass of around 330,000 times that of Earth.
